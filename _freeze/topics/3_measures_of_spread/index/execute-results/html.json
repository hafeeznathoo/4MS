The four quantities we are concerned with will be the **standard deviation**, **variance**, **inter quartile range (IQR)**, and **range**.\n\nThe big question to answer is why do we care? \nGenerally, data can be described with two measures - one of [central tendency]<https://mathformedstudents.netlify.app/topics/2%20Central%20Tendency/> and one of \n\nLets start with a simple data set for illustrative purposes with only five numbers: $(1, 4, 5, 10, 10)$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.937004\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 15.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUltimately the best measure to report will depend on you application - these measures are the first step to deeper statistical analysis.\n\n\n### Thank you!\n\nHope the above was helpful, a few concepts were touched on in this article - skew, data visualization, and so on - stay tuned for more posts diving deeper into those topics!\n\n\n## \n\n**References**\n\n1.  *El Omda S, Sergent SR.
