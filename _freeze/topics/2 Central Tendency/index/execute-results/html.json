The three quantities we are concerned with will be the **mean (average)**, **median**, and **mode**.\n\nThese are widely taught in pretty much every stats class, so here we will focus on conceptual meaning and interpretation.\n\nLets start with a simple data set for illustrative purposes with only five numbers: $(1, 4, 5, 10, 10)$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Mean (aka the Average)\n\nThe mean ($\\mu$) is defined as the sum of all members of the set ($x_i$'s) divided by the number of members in that set ($n$) - this works out to $30/5$ for our example giving a mean of $6$.\n\n$$\n\\mu = (\\Sigma x_i )/ n\n$$\n    \n### Median\n\nThe median is defined as the middle value in the set, also known as the 50th percentile. This value will represent the halfway point - half the numbers are less, and half more.\n\nIn our data set $(1, 4, 5, 10, 10)$, the median is $5$.\n\nIf there were two middle numbers - for example in $(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)$ - then average the two middle numbers. For this example, the median is $4.5$.\n\n\n### Mode\n\nThe mode is defined as the value which appears most frequently in the data set $(1, 4, 5, 10, 10)$, this is straightforward and is clearly the value $10$ in our sample data.\n\n### The Importance of Mean vs Median\n\nThese definitions are straightforward enough, and are often calculated with software (R, Excel, python, etc.) and not by hand. The importance is in understanding their utility - in particular Mean vs Median.\n\nThe mean can be affected by outliers - e.g. the mean of $(1,2,3,4,100)$ is $22$ - a high value considering the bulk of the data is below 5. The median is $3$ - much more representative of the bulk of the data. The median is commonly reported in clinical applications owing to its resistance to the effects of outliers.\n\nIn a normal (bell) curve, the mean and median are fairly similar - as expected when looking at the histogram below.\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen you have data which is not as close to a bell curve (demonstrated in the below histogram) - median can be more useful since it is not as susceptible to the effects of a long tail (also known as **skew**)\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUltimately the best measure to report will depend on you application - these measures are the first step to deeper statistical analysis.\n\n\n### Thank you!\n\nHope the above was helpful, a few concepts were touched on in this article - skew, data visualization, and so on - stay tuned for more posts diving deeper into those topics!\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n\n**References**\n\n1.  *Hurley M, Tenny S.
