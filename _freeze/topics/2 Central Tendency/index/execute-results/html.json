The three quantities we are concerned with will be the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**.\n\nThese are widely taught in pretty much every stats class, so here we will focus on conceptual meaning and use rather than formulas.\n\nLets start with a simple data set for illustrative purposes with only five numbers: $(1, 4, 5, 10, 10)$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe mean ($\\mu$) is defined as the sum of all members of the set ($x_i$'s) divided by the number of members in that set ($n$) - this works out to $ 30 / 5 $ for our example giving a mean of $6$.\n\n$$\n\\mu = (\\Sigma x_i )/ n\n$$\n\nThe median is defined as ...\n\n\n\n\nThe mode is defined as the value which appears most frequently in the data set $(1, 4, 5, 10, 10)$, this is straightforward and is clearly the value $10$ in our sample data.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  *Hurley M, Tenny S.
