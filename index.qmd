While a ton of great resources exist in the vastness of the world wide web, as medical students ourselves we know that **concise** explanations of concepts **at the appropriate level** with **relevant examples** can be the toughest thing to come by.

***Our goal was to create specific content to help medical students grasp core concepts in the most efficient way***
:::

Our [articles](https://formedstudents.netlify.app/applications.html) cover broad themes that are relevant to medical learners (Statistics, Physics, Finances, etc) - and present information using examples and visuals which we have found to be extremely useful in our own learning.

Thank you for stopping by!
