### Overview

Studying medicine involves the assimilation of a large amount of content and requires much effort from students to keep up and integrate this new knowledge on an ongoing basis.

Though memorization and studying of facts from slide shows and flash cards will form a large part of many students' studying, a great technique to promote better understanding over memorization is to model systems in intuitive but simple constructs.

The Tank-Pump-Pipe Model for the Four Categories of Shock is a great example of this - and a useful model to visualize the categories of shock.

### Tank-Pump-Pipe Model

Shock is the result of circulatory collapse - i.e. when your organs can no longer be perfused with blood.

There are many etiologies for shock - anaphylaxis, sepsis, neurogenic, hemorrhagic, mechanical, etc. but these can be broadly grouped into four categories.

Cardiogenic, Distributive, Hypovolemic, and Obstructive

These can of course be memorized directly or with a mnemonic - but visualizing the body's circulatory system as simple tank-pump-pipe system is more straightforward in understanding the underlying mechanisms.

-   The tank represents intravascular volume - the fluid available to perfuse end organs
-   The piping represents the vasculature
-   The pump represents the heart and corresponding cardiac output

With this model in mind, it becomes intuitive to define the four categories of shock as follows:

1.  **Cardiogenic** - Failure of the "pump", i.e nothing to pressurize the system to push fluid to end organs
2.  **Distributive** - "Leaky Pipes", the vasculature is unable to maintain adequate pressure - this represents peripheral vasodilatation (in anaphylactic shock, for example)
3.  **Hypovolemic -** The empty tank, all components functioning but a lack of volume (example - dehydration)
4.  **Obstructive** - A blockage - representing any condition which impairs cardiac output leading to lack of perfusion (Example - impaired filling, pericardial tamponade)

### Thank you!

Hope you found the above model useful for a more intuitive understanding!
